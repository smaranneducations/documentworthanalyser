## Key Features

- **Upload & Analyze** — Drop a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file. Get a full forensic report in under 30 seconds.
- **Document Fitness Check** — Only business/technology documents are accepted (proposals, pitches, whitepapers, advisory decks). If you upload something unrelated (a recipe, novel, personal letter, etc.), the app rejects it with an explanation of why it doesn't qualify.
- **Trust Score** — Every document gets a 0–100 trust score based on 25+ weighted drivers.
- **5-Layer AI Analysis** — Deception detection, bias analysis, logical fallacy identification, obsolescence risk, implementation readiness, hype vs reality, and more.
- **Key Findings** — AI highlights the most surprising or concerning facts from the document.
- **"Show Only My Files" Toggle** — When logged in, filter the home page file list to show only the documents you uploaded.
- **Print Summary** — Generate a styled PDF highlight reel to share with your team.
- **Assessment Rules Glossary** — Every metric is explained — what it means, why it matters, how it's calculated.

## Public vs Private Uploads

- **Public** — Visible to everyone in the file list. Anyone with the link can view the report.
- **Private** — Visible only to you. Others cannot see it in the list or access the report, even with a direct URL. Default when logged in.

## Comments: Anonymous vs Starred

Every section of the report has a discussion panel. Two types of comments:

**Anonymous**
- No login required
- No identity shown
- Gets an instant AI auto-reply

**Starred**
- Requires Google sign-in (popup appears if not logged in)
- Your email and timestamp are displayed
- Triggers an email alert to the admin
- Guarantees an admin response within 7 working days
- You get email notifications when anyone replies in that thread
- Also gets an instant AI auto-reply

Both types are visible to everyone — starred is not private, just identified.

## AI Auto-Reply

Every comment gets an instant response from DocDetector's AI. It reads the full document, the analysis, and all prior comments in that section to give a relevant reply. If it can't answer, it escalates to the admin.

## Duplicate Detection

If you upload a file that's already been analyzed, the app recognizes it and takes you straight to the existing report — no re-analysis needed.
